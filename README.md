# Virtual-Assistant


A very basic Virtual Assistant right now (class midterms managed to get in the way just as I was getting into the development)

Built with Python, hoping to be able to drop some of the outside frameworks in favor of custom algorithms eventually, frameworks are built just as a proof of concept.

There's many more fixes and features I want to add in soon!
